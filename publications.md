### Academic Interests
**Artificial Intelligence & Human Intelligence**: My journey into the realm of AI, particularly Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, has been fueled by a fascination with Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4. However, Geoffery Hinton's


**Linguistics**: My major in Linguistics has naturally led me to an interest in Computational Linguistics (CL), an exciting intersection between computer science and linguistics. This field allows me to apply my understanding of language structures in the digital domain. I am also captivated by a series of topics in the realm of syntax, semantics and psycholinguistics. These areas offer profound insights into how language interacts with our cognitive and neural processes.

My academic journey so far has been marked by significant experiences, such as participating in an undergraduate research program under Prof. Hu Hai, focusing on the performance of Natural Language Inference (NLI) models on Chinese and multilingual texts. This experience highlighted the challenges in language model accuracy, especially with complex linguistic elements like Chinese idioms. It has also taught me the importance of collaboration between linguists and experts in other domains for future advancements in this field.

As I continue my academic journey, I am eager to delve deeper into computational linguistics and NLP, understanding their limitations and potential, and contributing to the development of technologies that enable seamless communication between humans and machines.



### Self-directed Projects
#### **Testing LLMs with Chinese Xiehouyu Data** (In Progress)
*As the leader of the project, supervised by Prof. Hai Hu*
Xiehouyu(歇后语) is a unique form of expression in Chinese, characterized by its brevity, wit, and vivid imagery. It consists of two parts: the first part acts as a 'lead-in,' similar to a riddle's setup, while the second part serves as the 'backing,' akin to the riddle's answer, fitting naturally and appropriately. In practical use, people often only say the first half and omit the second, allowing the listener to understand and guess its true meaning, hence the name xiehouyu.
We aim to answer a series of RQs by designing a database that includes xiehouyu, including but not limited to:
- Does the model's reasoning from the 'lead-in' to the 'backing' of a riddle depend on context?
- Can the model understand manually created language riddles that do not exist in the current language?


#### **Undergraduate Research Program at SJTU: Performance of Language Models on parsing Chinese Idioms** (In Progress)
*As the leader of the project, supervised by Prof. Hai Hu*

Under the guidance of Professor Hai Hu, we explored pre-trained language models and Chinese idioms. Idioms possess both literal and figurative meanings, and their meanings are context-dependent. Our goal was test if the model is able to tell whether an idiom's meaning was literal or figurative in varying contexts.
In 2022-2023, we compiled test data containing Chinese idioms and conducted tests on three different masked models which are fine-tuned for NLI tasks.  ecently, we conducted a series of tests on existing advanced LLMs (OpenAI GPT family and other open-source models). We found that the models demonstrated significantly higher accuracy when dealing with idioms whose interpretations were literal.


### Projects at SJTU SFL's CL Lab
Under the guidance of Prof. Hu Hai
#### **Evaluating Pragmatic Reasoning of LLMs With Chinese Implicatures** (In Progress)
We manually created a dataset on conversational implicature, categorizing the dialogues according to Grice's Maxims to test the models' pragmatic abilities. Furthermore, we also attempted to discover similarities between the errors made by the models and humans.
The project is leaded by Shisen Yue and supervised by Prof. Hai Hu.
#### **Exploring large models' understanding of anaphor** (In Progress)
We aim to large models' acquisition of Binding Principles using various prompts. This research is still in its early stages, and more information will be released subsequently.
This project is leaded by Prof. Hai Hu.
