### Research in Progress
**LLM's Comprehension of Idioms and Figurative meaning**

Inspired by the Idiom NLI project, we will conduct a series of tests on existing Advanced LLMs to answer questions including, but not limited to: Can LLMs understand idioms and figurative language? In which categories of figurative language do these models perform better or worse? What factors might influence the performance of these models?



### Other Works
**Undergraduate Research: Performance of NLI Models on parsing Chinese Idioms** 

Instructed by professor Hai Hu, we studied pre-trained language models and the figurative meaning of language. We compiled test data containing Chinese idioms and conducted tests on three different RoBERTa-based models. We evaluated the performance of the models and examined the relationship between model performance and linguistic phenomena.



**PRP Program: Financial AI algorithms and fairness**

Instructed by professor Chunxiao Li, we reviewed literature on feature engineering and model interpretability, applied advanced classification algorithms such as LightGBM and XGBoost on the Home Credit dataset, and assessed whether existing AI models for credit exhibit discrimination in various aspects.
